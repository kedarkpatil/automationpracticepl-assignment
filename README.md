 ##  MyShop Website Assignment 
- http://www.automationpractice.pl

The motive of this project is to create [Test cases](https://github.com/kedarkpatil/automationpracticepl-assignment.git/tree/main/test-cases) and create automated tests in `C# with Selenium Webdriver using Nunit annotations and RestSharp libraries for api automated tests`(https://selenium.dev/) for the [automationpractice.pl](http://www.automationpractice.pl/) application. The project enhances all testing knowledge and methodologies by discovering test cases.

## AssignmentProject scope

- Designing test cases in [TestCasesWritten](https://github.com/kedarkpatil/automationpracticepl-assignment/tree/master/TestCasesWritten) folder.
- Execution of manual tests based on the designed test cases.
- Bug reporting in [BugsReported](https://github.com/kedarkpatil/automationpracticepl-assignment/tree/master/BugsReported) folder.
- Writing and running automated tests in C# with selenium using Page Object Model.
- Executing tests in chrome browser.
- It involves various testing methods including Functional,E2E(End to End), API Testing, Unit, Exploratory, Usability.

## Work environment:
- Windows 11, version 23H2
- Browser:
  - Google Chrome version 125.0.6422.142
- Selenium with C# (IDE:- Visual Studio Code 2019) with Nunit and RestSharp

## Tools used for Automation testing
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Selenium](https://selenium.dev/)
    - [C Sharp ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)


## Writing Of test cases and bugs
- Markup language files i.e with .md files
      

## Documentation

The Testing Document start with [TEST CASES](https://github.com/kedarkpatil/automationpracticepl-assignment/tree/master/TestCasesWritten) to the test results to the reported [BUGS](https://github.com/kedarkpatil/automationpracticepl-assignment/tree/master/BugsReported). This will enable a fuller understanding of the activities carried out and facilitate possible future reference.  


## Summary

This `My Shop website with url www.automationpractice.pl` project with assignment is dedicated to ensuring high-quality application testing, gaining variety of testing insights in all aspects of testing, and enhancing the testing process through efficient automation. I will also utilize a range of tools and technologies to achieve this in future.This project will also provide an opportunity to expand my knowledge of automation testing for UI(Web) and Api tests and refine my skills in short time.This is great workaround for all testers with all aspects of critical thinking and giving opportunity to enhance testing skillset.
